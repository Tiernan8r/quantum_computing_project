	abstract = {We show that a set of gates that consists of all one-bit quantum gates (U(2)) and the two-bit exclusive-or gate (that maps Boolean values \$(x,y)\$ to \$(x,x {\textbackslash}textbackslashoplus y)\$) is universal in the sense that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits \$n\$ (U(\$2Ë†n\$)) can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical AND of all remaining input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two-and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for \$n\$-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary \$n\$-bit unitary operations.},

	abstract = {In linear algebra, a complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U* is also its inverse, that is, if where I is the identity matrix. In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the conjugate transpose is referred to as the Hermitian adjoint of a matrix and is denoted by a dagger (â€ ), so the equation above is written The real analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grover%27s_algorithm&oldid=1075073481},
	abstract = {In quantum computing, Grover's algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, refers to a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just O ( N ) \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdisplaystyle O(\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt \{N\}\})\} evaluations of the function, where N \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdisplaystyle N\} is the size of the function's domain. It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996.The analogous problem in classical computation cannot be solved in fewer than O ( N ) \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdisplaystyle O(N)\} evaluations (because, on average, one has to check half of the domain to get a 50\% chance of finding the right input). Charles H. Bennett, Ethan Bernstein, Gilles Brassard, and Umesh Vazirani proved that any quantum solution to the problem needs to evaluate the function O ( N ) \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdisplaystyle O(\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt \{N\}\})\} times, so Grover's algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Since researchers generally believe that NP-complete problems are difficult because their search spaces have essentially no structure, the optimality of Grover's algorithm for unstructured search suggests (but does not prove) that quantum computers cannot solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time.Unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup. However, even quadratic speedup is considerable when N \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdisplaystyle N\} is large, and Grover's algorithm can be applied to speed up broad classes of algorithms. Grover's algorithm could brute-force a 128-bit symmetric cryptographic key in roughly 264 iterations, or a 256-bit key in roughly 2128 iterations. As a result, it is sometimes suggested that symmetric key lengths be doubled to protect against future quantum attacks.},
